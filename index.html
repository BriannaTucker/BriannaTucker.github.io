For my tutorial project in Introduction to Data Sconce, I plan to manipulate data related to statistics from matches of online video games such as Overwatch, Dota 2, and Tom Clancyâ€™s Rainbow 6 Siege. There are vast amounts of data available to the public pertaining to individual matches, as well as aggregated data illustrating world averages and popular player preferences. Data biases in regard to the aggregated data can be avoided because this data is posted on multiple websites, so it is possible to find the true averages rather than any impossible inflated averages. 

I plan to work on this project with respect to this class without a partner; however, it should be noted that the effort I put into the data collection and refinery is also going into my computer science capstone project for I will use the same dataset for both projects. I had initially intended going through the data pipeline process for these datasets with respect to the computer science capstone project, but I extended the idea to make it applicable for this course.
