<p>For my tutorial project for Introduction to Data Sconce, I plan to manipulate data related to statistics from matches of online multiplayer video games such as Overwatch, Dota 2, and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege. There are vast amounts of data available to the public pertaining to individual matches, as well as aggregated data illustrating world averages and popular player preferences. Data biases in regard to the aggregated data can be avoided because this data is posted on multiple websites, so it is possible to find the true averages rather than any impossible inflated averages. Such sources that will be explored are the sites Winston’s Lab, DotaBuff, and R6Stats. These resources archive and publish legacy stats from past matches and are updated regularly with new match statistics, meaning the data is current; this means that the trends and observations gathered from the data do not have to be subjected to irrelevance.</p>  

<p> I plan to work on this project with respect to this class without a partner; however, it should be noted that the effort I put into the data collection and refinery is also going into my computer science capstone project for I will use the same dataset for both projects. I had initially intended going through the data pipeline process for these datasets with respect to the computer science capstone project, but I extended the idea to make it applicable for this course. Although I have two partners for the capstone project, I will be the primary data fetcher and manipulator. </p>
<p>The reason as to why this dataset was chosen is because it is plentiful and robust. Each user has many variables including eliminating enemy units, healing friendly units, and participating at the objective location. Because every occurrence of the data is complete (meaning that there aren’t any missing data), these datasets can effectively be used to form observations and identify trends.</p> 
<p>As the data is accumulated, many questions can be posed. For example, “Which character has the highest win rate on average?”, “What map and team composition leads to higher percent win rate for a particular player?”, “Is there an observed damage to healing ratio that elevates a team’s odds at winning?”, etc. By taking into consideration such questions, the dataset is more manageable for there is a particular goal in mind amidst the vast amount of information. With respect to my dataset and the computer science capstone project, I aspire to observe similarities in several individual matches compared with the averages of the aggregated data to see if these trends withstand in a trial observation.</p>
<p>I have already begun making progress in accessing the sources which contain the match statistics. I plan to extract, transform, and load the data so it is in a more manageable format ready to be analyzed. I hope to be able to manipulate the match statistics such that trends and observations like win-rate potentials can be calculated before the end of future matches. I also hope to observe subtle nuances in the gameplay such that an ideal strategy can be formulated.</p>
